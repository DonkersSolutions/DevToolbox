### ⚠️ **PRE-ALPHA & SOURCE STATUS**
* **Usage:** This is a **Public Pre-Alpha**. It is free to use but provided "as-is" under a Fair Use license.
* **Source Code:** The repository is currently **Private** while we stabilize the core architecture. We intend to transition to a fully **Open Source** model once the application reaches a stable 1.0 release.
* **Use at your own risk:** Expect bugs, breaking changes, and frequent updates.

## 🛠 What is it?
**Donkers Dev Toolbox** is a high-performance "Swiss Army Knife" for your daily development workflow, built with **Tauri 2.0** and **Rust**.

### Core Philosophy
* **Local-First:** Your data stays on your machine. Import/Export functionality works directly with your local file system.
* **No Bloat:** A native desktop experience that stays out of your way (~35MB RAM usage).
* **Privacy:** No tracking, no cloud-syncing, no accounts required.

## ✨ Current Features

* **Status:** Supports basic git operations branches/commits/pull/push/fetch/tags/stashes.

### ⚙️ Developer Utilities
* **UUID Generator:** Fast, offline ID generation.
* **BASE64 Encode/Decode:** Clean up messy data locally.
