### ⚠️ **PRE-ALPHA & SOURCE STATUS**
* **Usage:** This is a **Public Pre-Alpha**. It is free to use but provided "as-is" under a Fair Use license.
* **Source Code:** The repository is currently **Private** while we stabilize the core architecture. We intend to transition to a fully **Open Source** model once the application reaches a stable 1.0 release.
* **Use at your own risk:** Expect bugs, breaking changes, and frequent updates.

---

## 🛠 What is it?
**Donkers Dev Toolbox** is a high-performance "Swiss Army Knife" for your daily development workflow, It leverages a **Rust** backend via **Tauri 2.0** and a reactive **Vue 3** frontend to deliver a native experience with a minimal footprint.

### Core Philosophy
* **Local-First:** Your data stays on your machine. Import/Export functionality works directly with your local file system.
* **No Bloat:** A native desktop experience that stays out of your way (~35MB RAM usage).
* **Privacy:** No tracking, no cloud-syncing, no accounts required.

## ✨ Current Features

### 🧩 Mini Applications
Focused tools to keep your project on track:
* **Widget Dashboard:** A customizable space for your daily dev stats.
* **Kanban Board:** Drag-and-drop task management, stored locally in your toolbox.

### 🐙 Git GUI (Experimental)
A visual interface for your local repositories.
* **Prerequisite:** You must have **Git** installed on your system, and SSH setup, the app can help you with that step (See GitGUI → Settings)
* **Status:** Supports basic git operations branches/commits/pull/push/fetch/tags/stashes.

### ⚙️ Developer Utilities
* **UUID Generator:** Fast, offline ID generation.
* **BASE64 Encode/Decode:** Encode and/or Decode base64 strings in a flash.
* **JWT Decoder:** Decode JWT tokens for quick inspection.
* **Data Portability:** Full support for importing/exporting your settings and data to local files.

### 💾 Data Portability & Compatibility
While **Data Portability** is a core pillar of this project, please be aware that our internal data schemas are evolving rapidly during this Pre-Alpha phase.

* **Compatibility:** Export files created in an older version may not be compatible with newer versions until we reach a stable data format (v1.0).
* **Recommendation:** Keep a backup of your data, but expect to perform a "fresh start" if the data structure undergoes a major shift between updates.

### 🪟 Windows Support Status
Windows is currently a **secondary preview platform**.

* **Core Tools:** All local utilities (JSON, UUID, etc.) and mini apps use cross-platform logic and are fully functional.
* **Git Operations:** We use **Gix** for high-performance, read-only operations, which work across all platforms. However, operations requiring **SSH authentication** currently shell out to system Git.
* **Current Limitation:** Due to differences in path handling and line endings (`CRLF`), SSH-based operations on Windows are experimental and not currently optimized.
* **Focus:** We are not actively troubleshooting Windows-specific Git/SSH issues while we focus on core feature stability for macOS and Linux.

## 🛡️ Installation & Security Notes

As this project is in a **Pre-Alpha** stage, the binaries are not yet digitally signed or notarized. Your operating system will likely flag the application as a security risk. This is expected behavior for unsigned software.

### 🍎 For macOS Users
If macOS claims the app is **"Damaged"** or should be moved to the Trash, it is simply because the app is unsigned. To bypass this:

1. Drag the application into your **Applications** folder.
2. Open your **Terminal** and run:
   ```shell
   sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Donkers\ Dev\ Toolbox.app
   ```

### 🪟 For Windows Users
Windows **SmartScreen** will likely prevent the installer from starting with a blue banner stating "Windows protected your PC." This is a standard for apps that are not yet digitally signed.

1. Click the **"More info"** link (this is the small underlined text directly under the main warning message).
2. A new button labeled **"Run anyway"** will appear at the bottom of the window.
3. Click **Run anyway** to start the installation.

### 🐧 For Linux Users
To install the `.deb` or `.rpm`package and ensure all dependencies are correctly handled, use the terminal:

Debian/Ubuntu:
```shell
sudo apt install ./Donkers.Dev.Toolbox_0.1.4_amd64.deb
``` 
Fedora/RHEL/OpenSUSE:
```shell
sudo dnf install ./Donkers.Dev.Toolbox-0.1.4-1.x86_64.rpm
```
